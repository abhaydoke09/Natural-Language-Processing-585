One way to think of this is that cosine similarity is just, um, the cosine function, which has this property (for non-negative $x$ and $y$). Another way to think of it is, to work through the situations of maximum and minimum similarity between two context vectors, starting from the definition above.\n",

    "Note: a good way to understand the cosine similarity function is that the numerator cares about whether the $x$ and $y$ vectors are correlated. If $x$ and $y$ tend to have high values for the same contexts, the numerator tends to be big. The denominator can be thought of as a normalization factor: if all the values of $x$ are really large, for example, dividing by the square root of their sum-of-squares prevents the whole thing from getting arbitrarily large. In fact, dividing by both these things (aka their norms) means the whole thing can’t go higher than 1.\n",

If you don’t have enough memory available, your computer will get very slow because the OS will start swapping. If you have to use a machine without that much memory available, you can instead implement in a streaming approach by using the `stream_contexts()` generator function to access the data; this lets you iterate through the data from disk, one vector at a time, without putting everything into memory. You can see its use in the loading function. (You could also alternatively use a key-value or other type of database, but that’s too much work for this assignment.)"

    "Some research has proposed to use additive operations on word embeddings to solve the analogy: take the vector $(v_{king}-v_{man}+v_{woman})$ and find the most-similar word to it.  One way to explain this idea: if you take \"king\", get rid of its attributes/contexts it shares with \"man\", and add in the attributes/contexts of \"woman\", hopefully you'll get to a point in the space that has king-like attributes but the \"man\" ones replaced with \"woman\" ones.\n",

If the output makes sense, explain why we can capture such relation between words using an unsupervised algorithm. Where does the information come from? On the other hand, if the output does not make sense, propose an explanation why the algorithm fails on this case.\n",
